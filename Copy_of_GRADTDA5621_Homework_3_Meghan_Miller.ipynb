This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The on-demand nature of generators also means we may not have to generate values that won't be used, and thus would have been wasted cycles if they were generated. This means your program can use only the values needed without having to wait until all of them have been generated.\n",

        "1. **Processing large amounts of data:** generators provide calculation on-demand, also called lazy evaluation. This technique is used in stream processing.\n",
        "2. **Piping:** stacked generators can be used as pipes, in a manner similar to Unix pipes.\n",
